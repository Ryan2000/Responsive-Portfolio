        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>
            I come from the land of the ice and snow, and then moved to Los Angeles in 2007. After several years working in television production/post, I made the transition into advertising. I'm a fan of analytics, data, and tech. However, I also enjoy art; painting, writing, and sketching. When I'm not at work, or studying, you can find me by the beach throwing frisbee, or riding my bike around Venice.

        <p>
            When I moved to LA I had some money in my pocket, a few cases of books, clothing, a few pillows, and a mattress pad. Now I have a career, dear friends, an amazing girlfriend, and rescue dog, Lettux, to which I'm allergic. Life couldn't be better.
